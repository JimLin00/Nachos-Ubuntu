# Nachos-4.0 for Operating System Course

## Before Starting Lab2

### Hint

If you haven't finished Lab1, it's fine - Lab2 is independent from Lab1.
Regardless of whether you have completed Lab1 or not, you must download this source code again.
If you find it too troublesome and you have already completed Lab1, you can simply download the "code" folder and overwrite the existing one.

## Docker

### Prerequisite(Ubuntu)

### Build

```bash
# Download the source code if you haven't
git clone https://github.com/JimLin00/Nachos-Ubuntu.git nachos
cd nachos
bash install.sh
```
