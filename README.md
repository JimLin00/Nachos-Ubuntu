# Nachos-4.0 for Operating System Course

## Before Starting Lab2

### Hint

Regardless of whether you have completed Lab1 or not, you must download this source code again.

If you find it too troublesome and you have already completed Lab1, you can simply download the "code" folder and overwrite the existing one.

In other words, if you haven't finished Lab1, it's fine - Lab2 is independent from Lab1.
## Docker

### Prerequisite(Ubuntu)
